My instances of vim are build using a forked Homebrew/macvim formula. I set up a tap just to version/evolve this fork separately, instead of screwing with Homebrew locally in my systems.

## How to install my fork?

My fork lives in [lsdr/homebrew-stan](https://github.com/lsdr/homebrew-stan). Just `brew tap lsdr/stan` and then `brew install lsdr/stan/macvim`.

You can also install via URL:
```
brew install https://raw.github.com/lsdr/homebrew-stan/master/macvim.rb
```
